Hi,

Im a am developing my website using django.

I would like, within the the space bordered in blue, corresponding to the div id = all-countries:

<div id="all-countries" class="sub-section">
            <h2 class="sub-section-title">All Countries</h2>
            <div class="filler"></div>

        </div>
To display 2 things:

On left side (taking 70% of the width), an interactive world map highly cutomizable,
showing each country in a different color depending on data that i have in postgresql database. I also want when I hover to display data stored in database.

On right side, I would like I would like to display a small chart.

But maybe lets first work on the left side. Please I need your help
